## 📌 What to Submit Here

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Word frequency analysis
- Class distribution
- Missing value detection
- Word clouds and bar plots

### 🔢 Classification Models
- Preprocessing pipeline (cleaning, encoding, etc.)
- Baseline model (e.g., TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT)

### 🛠 Feature Engineering
- Handling repetition or duplicated fields
- Cleaning text from patterns (e.g., "How to use", "Safety advice", etc.)

### 📈 Model Evaluation
- Use metrics like Accuracy, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix
- Save trained models or checkpoint states
