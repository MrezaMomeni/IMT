🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Predictor
A machine learning-powered web app that predicts individual medical insurance expenses based on personal and lifestyle information. This project is built using Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn, and provides both data visualization and cost prediction through a simple, interactive interface.

📌 Overview
This app utilizes a regression model trained on a real-world dataset containing features like:

Age

Sex

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Number of children

Smoking status

Region

The goal is to estimate the insurance charges based on these inputs — a task that's highly relevant in insurance tech, healthcare analytics, and cost forecasting.
