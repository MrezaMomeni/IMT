# ðŸ’Š Medicines Information Dataset (MID) Challenge

## Overview

This challenge focuses on analyzing and utilizing textual medicine data for multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The MID dataset contains detailed information about over 192,000 pharmaceutical products across 44 therapeutic classes.

Participants are encouraged to:

- Explore and understand the structure of drug-related textual information.
- Build classification models to assign therapeutic classes based on medicine descriptions.
- Generate structured summaries using NLP techniques.
- Evaluate different deep learning and traditional approaches for medicine-related tasks.

## Challenge Tasks

### ðŸ§ª Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze distributions of therapeutic classes.
- Visualize the frequency of different drug categories and common terms in descriptions.
- Detect missing data or duplicated entries.

### ðŸ§  Text Classification
- Use text features (like usage, benefits, chemical class, etc.) to predict `therapeutic_class`.
- Build models using classical ML (e.g., TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and compare with deep learning (e.g., BERT).

### ðŸ”„ Text Generation (Optional)
- Generate short summaries or safety tips based on other fields.
- Try prompt engineering techniques with LLMs.

### ðŸ§® Therapeutic Class Distribution Analysis
- Use the `Therapeutic_class_counts.xlsx` to visualize and interpret how drugs are distributed across medical categories.

## Submission Guidelines

- Your final notebook must include:
  - Clear EDA
  - Modeling pipeline
  - Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1, etc.)
  - Interpretations and next steps
- All code should be placed under the `Codes` folder.
- Submit by Pull Request or link to your fork.
